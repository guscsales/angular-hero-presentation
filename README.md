# Angular Hero Presentation

I have created this project to explain the simple features of Angular and how these works, using also an image presentation.

Note which this project uses Angular-CLI. So before follow the steps below, it has been necessary install the core of Angular.

This project uses [M.A.R.V.I.N.](https://github.com/hebsix/marvin-dashboard) dashboard template by AgÃªncia Hebsix.

## Some Features

* CRUD using Components
* Services
* Routing

## Prerequisites

Both the CLI and generated project have dependencies that require Node 6.9.0 or higher, together
with NPM 3 or higher.

## Installation

### NodeJS and NPM
Access the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) official website and download the "Latest Features". Don't forget to check the npm (node package modules) during installation.

### Sass

#### Note for Windows
Before you start using Sass you will need to install Ruby. The fastest way to get Ruby on your Windows computer is to use [Ruby Installer](http://rubyinstaller.org/). It's a single-click installer that will get everything set up for you super fast.

The installer will also install a Ruby command line powershell application that will let you use the Ruby libraries.

```bash
gem install sass
```

### Angular CLI
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
